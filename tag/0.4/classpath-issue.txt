The client-side communication code has been re-implemented using Apache HttpClient. This may require MATLAB users to make a configuration change in order to run LAPIS, depending on their current configuration. The following line from $matlabroot/toolbox/local/classpath.txt MUST be commented out (if it is present) or LAPIS will not work:

$matlabroot/java/jarext/axis2/httpcore.jar

To edit $matlabroot/toolbox/local/classpath.txt, do the following:

1. Select a text editor, right-click, and select 'Run as Administrator'.
2. In MATLAB, type the following to display the location of the classpath.txt file: [matlabroot '\toolbox\local\classpath.txt']
3. Open the classpath.txt file in your editor from the first step.
4. Comment out the line that ends in 'httpcore.jar'
5. Save the file and exit the text editor.
6. Re-start MATLAB.
