# LAPIS

## About

LAPIS is a framework for incorporating computational steering in Java and MATLAB applications. It allows applications to expose variables through a REST interface so that the values of those variables can be retrieved and set at runtime by users or external processes. It also allows programmers to build networks of computationally-steered applications, each of which can be steered programmatically or manually through the REST interface exposed by each network node.
